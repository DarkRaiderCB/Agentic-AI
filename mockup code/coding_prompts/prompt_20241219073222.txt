Create a Python-based Library Book Management System with the following modules and architectural layout. Ensure adherence to the specified requirements for seamless functionality and clarity throughout the development process.

### Project Structure

1. **Database Module (`database.py`):**
   - **Functionality:** Handle all SQLite database operations.
   - **Features:**
     - Establish a connection to the SQLite database.
     - Set up and create the required tables if they do not exist.
     - Implement functions for:
        - Create: Add new book records.
        - Read: Retrieve all records or perform searches based on title, author, or ISBN.
        - Update: Modify existing book details.
        - Delete: Remove books from the database using identifiers.
   - **Location:** `/libbookmgmt/db`

2. **Streamlit UI Module (`app.py`):**
   - **Functionality:** Provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the database through Streamlit.
   - **Features:**
     - Sidebar navigation for different CRUD functionalities.
     - Form inputs for adding and updating book details.
     - Tables or lists for viewing and interacting with current book records.
   - **Location:** `/libbookmgmt/ui`

3. **Optional Authentication Module (`auth.py`):**
   - **Functionality:** Simple user authentication to control access, if implemented.
   - **Features:**
     - Basic authentication check using passwords.
     - Restrict access to certain functions based on user login status.
   - **Location:** `/libbookmgmt/security`

4. **Main Execution File (`main.py`):**
   - **Functionality:** Initialize the application and connect UI with database operations.
   - **Features:**
     - Start the Streamlit server.
     - Link each UI component with the corresponding database function.
   - **Location:** `/libbookmgmt`

### Instructions

- **SQLite Database Setup:** In `database.py`, initialize a connection to an SQLite database file named `library.db`. Use SQLite queries to set up the table `books` with fields `id` (Primary Key, Auto-Increment), `title`, `author`, and `isbn`.

- **Streamlit Application Design:** In `app.py`, create a modular layout using Streamlit's sidebar functionality for easy navigation between CRUD operations. Each section should include forms or data representations pertinent to the task (e.g., table for records).

- **Integrating Modules:** Utilize `main.py` to orchestrate the execution flow, ensuring that the database functions are effectively tied into the UI elements.

- **Optional Authentication:** If implementing authentication, define necessary login forms and session checks in `auth.py`, integrating security checks within the UI flow as needed.

- **Dependencies:** Ensure dependencies such as `streamlit` and `sqlite3` are included in a requirements file for easy setup.

By following this detailed structure, the application will be robust, adaptable to additional features, and ensures a smooth user experience.
