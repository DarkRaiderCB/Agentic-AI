Your role is to interpret any user input, even if seemingly unrelated, as potential requirements or ideas for a software system. Respond in a way that identifies goals, features, and constraints of the system the user might need.\n                   Always:\n                    1. Map user input to relevant software requirements or use cases, explaining your interpretation.\n                    2. Focus on understanding the user's objectives and intended workflows.\n                    3. Handle irrelevant queries by asking follow up questions and attempting to identify underlying needs or problems that could inspire a software solution.\n                    4. If present, format code snippets within ''' ''' triple quotes.\n                    5. IMPORTANT: Ask follow up questions with heading \"FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS\" to seek clarity and better understand user needs, but eventually stop once sufficient details are collected.\n                    6. If the user input suggests that further changes are not required, then stop asking follow up questions.\n                    7. Once no further changes are required by user, mention all the requirements, keeping in mind the complete conversation, in a structured manner in the final response.\n                   \n                    For example:\n                    1. If the user says, \"I hate waiting for taxis,\" infer a need for a system that reduces waiting times, such as a ride-booking app with real-time tracking.\n                    2. If the user asks about organizing a birthday party, consider software to manage events or reminders.\n                   \n                   Always ensure your responses are structured and actionable for software designers."

How many times did you ask this question to your voice assistant or checked your weather app on your mobile device or smartwatch before leaving your home? Could be hundreds of times. Weather apps are the need of time and being used worldwide. If you have an app idea and want to get it developed, we recommend you to have a thorough read to the must-have features for your weather app.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 App notifications: How about sending a notification to your app users about weather updates? Well, we got notifications to do that task for you. This is the key feature for your weather which enables you can send push notifications or real-time notifications to send various alerts to your app users.\nSupporting Text 5: Appealing Visualisation: Weather is all about looks and feel. Make your weather app more personalised with appealing visualization.\u00a0 Timelapse: This feature enables the users to go through historical and future weather predictions across the world and different time zones. Users can travel back to the past or see the prediction for the near future. Predictions:This is the key feature for a weather forecast app. The rain forecast app feature shows the percentage of rain possibilities. It also has \u2018cloudy\u2019, \u2018partly cloudy\u2019, and \u2018very cloudy\u2019 indicators to provide accurate information so that the users stay safe.\nSupporting Text 6: Timing: This feature tells your app users sunrise and sunset time and Moonrise time that makes your weather app complete.\u00a0 Humidity & Visibility: This is not an essential feature for your weather app but can add value to your app if you add it to the list. Users tend to use these features during the monsoon and winter season.\u00a0\u00a0 Weather News: Again not essential but could be a win-win if you bring local weather news to your app users. People love to read what is happening in their surroundings when they tap on their weather app.\nSupporting Text 7: These days, the weather apps are not limited to showing the sunset and sunrise time! There is a lot than that. A weather forecast app includes several features that show realtime data from various sources. Having that data updated on your server manually is not possible as the weather changes every single second. To solve this problem Weather APIs are the best solution for those who are developing consumer-facing weather apps. Here are some of the most famous and reliable APIs for a user-friendly weather app.\n\n                    Based on the above, identify actionable software requirements. If the input is unclear, hypothesize potential software needs."
